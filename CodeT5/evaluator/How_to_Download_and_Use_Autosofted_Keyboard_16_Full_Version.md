In this article, we will show you how to download and use Autosofted Keyboard 1.6 Full Version in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download Autosofted Keyboard 1.6 Full Version
 
To download Autosofted Keyboard 1.6 Full Version, you can visit the official website of Autosofted[^2^] or click on this link[^1^]. The file size is about 1 MB and it is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10. You do not need to install anything, just run the executable file after downloading.
 
## Step 2: Set up your Start/Stop and Play hotkeys
 
After running the program, you will see a simple interface with two sections: Record and Playback. In the Record section, you can select a hotkey to start and stop recording your key presses. In the Playback section, you can select a hotkey to play back your recorded key presses.
 
To set up your hotkeys, click on the Set button next to each option and press the desired key combination on your keyboard. For example, you can choose F9 as your Start/Stop hotkey and F10 as your Play hotkey. You can also change the hotkeys later by clicking on the Edit button.
 
## Step 3: Record your key presses
 
To record your key presses, press your Start/Stop hotkey (F9 in our example) and then press the keys that you want to automate. You can press any key on your keyboard, including modifier keys like Ctrl, Alt, and Shift. You can also hold down a key for a longer duration or press multiple keys at once.
 
When you are done recording your key presses, press your Start/Stop hotkey again (F9 in our example) to stop the recording. You will see a list of your recorded key presses in the Record section, along with their timestamps and durations.
 
## Step 4: Adjust your playback options
 
In the Playback section, you can adjust some options for playing back your recorded key presses. You can choose how many times you want to repeat the playback (from 1 to infinite), how long you want to wait between each playback (from 0 to 9999 milliseconds), and how long you want to wait between each key press (from 10 to 9999 milliseconds).
 
You can also edit your recorded key presses by clicking on the Edit Script button. This will open a text editor where you can modify or delete any line of code that represents a key press. For example, you can change the duration of a key press by changing the number after the colon (:). You can also add comments by using semicolons (;).
 
## Step 5: Play back your recorded key presses
 
To play back your recorded key presses, press your Play hotkey (F10 in our example) and watch as the program simulates your key presses on your screen. You can stop the playback at any time by pressing your Play hotkey again (F10 in our example) or by closing the program.
