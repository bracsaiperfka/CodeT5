The scenery features realistic and detailed 3D models of the airport buildings, terminals, hangars, jetways, and vehicles. It also includes custom ground textures, night lighting, dynamic shadows, seasonal variations, and animated traffic. The scenery is compatible with default and third-party mesh, landclass, and AI traffic.
 
San Jose del Cabo MMSD is a popular tourist destination, serving flights from the USA, Canada, Europe, and other parts of Mexico. The airport has two runways, one of which is over 3 km long and can accommodate large jets. The scenery offers a challenging approach over the mountains and the sea, with stunning views of the desert landscape and the coastline.
 
The scenery is available for purchase at the Bajasim website for $19.99 USD. It requires FS2004 or FSX with SP2 or Acceleration installed. A free demo version is also available for download.
  
The scenery also includes the nearby town of San Jose del Cabo, which is the oldest settlement in Baja California Sur. The town has a rich history and culture, with colonial architecture, art galleries, shops, and restaurants. The town is also known for its annual festival of San Jose, which takes place in March and features music, dance, and fireworks.
 
Another attraction near the airport is the Cabo Pulmo National Park, which is a marine reserve and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park is home to the only living coral reef in the Gulf of California, and hosts a variety of marine life, such as whales, dolphins, turtles, rays, and fish. The park offers opportunities for snorkeling, diving, kayaking, and hiking.
 
Bajasim is a team of passionate flight simmers and developers who aim to create realistic and immersive sceneries for Mexico and Latin America. Their previous products include La Paz MMLP, Tijuana MMTJ, Los Cabos MMSD, and San Jose Costa Rica MROC. They are currently working on their next project: Guadalajara MMGL.
  
The airport of San Jose del Cabo MMSD is part of the Grupo Aeroportuario del PacÃ­fico (GAP), which operates 12 airports in Mexico. The airport handled over 5.6 million passengers in 2019, making it the seventh busiest airport in the country. The airport has two terminals: Terminal 1 for domestic flights and Terminal 2 for international flights. The airport also has a general aviation area and a military base.
 
The scenery of San Jose del Cabo MMSD is designed to work seamlessly with other Bajasim sceneries, such as Los Cabos MMSD, which covers the nearby airport of Cabo San Lucas. The two airports are connected by a highway and offer different flight experiences. Los Cabos MMSD is a smaller and more scenic airport, with a single runway and a challenging approach over the hills and the sea.
 
The scenery of San Jose del Cabo MMSD is a must-have for flight simmers who enjoy flying in Mexico and Latin America. The scenery offers a realistic and immersive representation of the airport and its surroundings, with high-quality 3D models, textures, lighting, and animations.
