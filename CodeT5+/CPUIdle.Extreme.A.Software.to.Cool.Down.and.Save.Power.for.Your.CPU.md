In the main window, you can switch between different tabs to access different features and settings. In the CPU Info tab, you can see information about your CPU, such as clock speed, physical memory, and graphics driver. In the StartUp tab, you can enable the software to start automatically or optimize your CPU and chipset at startup. In the TaskBar tab, you can choose to display the idle status on the taskbar, and see the total time, percentage, and current percentage of CPU idle. In the Auto-Off Windows tab, you can create a list of applications that you want CPUIdle Extreme to disable when they are running in Windows.
 
CPUIdle Extreme works by using several mechanisms to keep your CPU cool. It can shut down your CPU when it is not used (online cooling), optimize your CPU for maximum cooling effect, and optimize your chipset for maximum cooling effect (supported chipsets only). It also integrates with MotherBoard Monitor, a software that can read the temperature sensors of your motherboard. You can adjust the level of cooling and optimization for your CPU and chipset in the StartUp tab.
 
CPUIdle Extreme is a useful software for users who want to reduce the temperature and power consumption of their CPU. It can help you enhance the stability and performance of your system, enable overclocking, and increase the life span of your CPU.
